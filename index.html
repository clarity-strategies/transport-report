        <p class="col2">The number of road traffic casualties on Lincolnshire's
            roads is monitored by the Lincolnshire Road Safety
            Partnership and is a key part of their road safety role.
            
            Table 20 below shows the data since 2000
            broken down into fatal and serious casualties,
            while Figure 35 shows the number of fatal and
            serious casualties graphically.</p>

                <h2>Key Points</h2>
            <ul class="auto-grid">
                <li>Since 2003, when 104 people died on
                    Lincolnshire roads, there has been a generally
                    downward trend in the number of fatalities.</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
                <li>2017 saw a large rise in the number of
                    serious casualties, although the overall
                    number of casualties fell to just under
                    2,600, the lowest on record.</li>
                <li>2020 saw a reduction in the overall number of
                    serious/fatal incidents from the previous three
                    years, possibly due to the reduction in vehicular
                    movement seen during the lockdown period.</li>
                <li>Since 2020, the numbers of people killed
                    or seriously injured on our roads have
                    gradually decreased.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </li>
